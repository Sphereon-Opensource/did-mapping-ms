## Building and Running
* Clone git repo
    ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:Sphereon/did-mapping-ms.git

  ```
* Setting up Mongo

      ```bash
      sudo service mongod start
      mongo
      > use did_mapping

   * If Mongo is not running in the default location, configure DID Mapping with the correct Mongo information. Create an `application.properties`, copy and replace the following variables in `<>` with your own values.
      ````bash
     spring.data.mongodb.host=<mongo-host>
     spring.data.mongodb.port=<mongo-host-port>
     spring.data.mongodb.database=did_mapping
